<h3>CATALOGUE OF VIOLENT AND DESTRUCTIVE EARTHQUAKES<br /> IN THE PHILIPPINES
(1599-1909).</h3>
<br />

<p><b>Introduction</b>.&mdash;The occasion for publishing this catalogue of
Philippine earthquakes which were of violent and destructive character
has been furnished by a request from Prof. John Milne for a list of
such phenomena, to be included in the General Earthquake Catalogue
which this eminent seismologist is preparing under the auspices of the
British Association for the Advancement of Science. The said general
catalogue has been undertaken with a view toward reducing to
uniformity and completing those published years ago by Robert Mallet
(1859) and Perrey (1844-1871). The form adopted for Professor Milne's
new catalogue is very concise, comprising only the date, intensity,
and region together with principal localities affected. It will
contain only the earthquakes of intensities VII to X according to the
scale of De Rossi-Forel, and these will be divided into three classes:
Class I will be formed by the earthquakes of sufficient force to
produce cracks in buildings and to throw down chimneys; they
correspond to force VII of De Rossi-Forel. Class II consists of the
earthquakes which not only threw down chimneys but also walls and some
weak structures; force VIII of De Rossi-Forel. Class III comprises the
earthquakes which caused general destruction; force IX and X of De
Rossi-Forel. As this classification is as purely conventional as every
other and adopted only in the catalogue mentioned, we do not employ it
in the present catalogue of Philippine earthquakes, but retain the
almost universally adopted scale of De Rossi-Forel. We shall also
present more details as to the towns and buildings damaged, the number
of victims and other disastrous effects than enter into the catalogue
of Professor Milne.</p>

<p>Hence, the differences between the list prepared for Professor Milne
as well as the partial catalogue published in our Monthly Bulletin for
February of the present year consist in the following: (1) This
catalogue contains also several earthquakes whose intensities were
between VI and VII, while in the former only such figure as according
to their effects were decidedly of force VII. (2) The new catalogue is
more complete as to details concerning the towns, etc., which have
been destroyed.</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that we are unable to present here a complete
historical catalogue of all the destruction wrought in the Archipelago
by earthquakes since the time when Legaspi and Urdaneta first set foot
on these shores. But the old chroniclers, who dwell upon the political
happenings with an attention to detail which is occasionally overdone,
were invariably laconic when there was question of earthquakes and
similar natural phenomena; as a rule they were satisfied with
mentioning the occurrence in a general and therefore vague way,
without any attempt at precision as to dates and places. Still the
writers in the Philippines did nothing worse than imitate their
colleagues throughout the rest of the world. This fact is responsible
for the great contrast exhibited by our catalogue as regards the
number and details of earthquakes which occurred prior to 1800,
records of which have been preserved, and the same data for the period
from 1800 to the present time. This same difference is observable in
all catalogues of a similar nature, even in those which cover
phenomena which occurred in Europe. As to the Philippine writers, an
additional excuse is found in the peculiar conditions of life in these
Islands. As far as we know, only two earthquakes which took place
during the period which alone can come under consideration&mdash;that is,
since the discovery of the Archipelago&mdash;have claimed a considerable
number of victims, and these in the capital, because outside of
Manila&mdash;if we except two or three of the principal cities&mdash;the
buildings which could become dangerous during an earthquake have
always been few.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>Moreover, in a country in which fires consume every year thousands of
dwellings and where the terrible typhoons frequently destroy whole
towns with heavy loss of lives, the damage done by earthquakes has
rarely been so great as to impress those occurrences indelibly upon
the memory. This is beyond doubt one of the reasons why prior to the
beginning of the nineteenth century hardly any data can be found
concerning the numerous earthquakes which during the preceding two
centuries must have occurred in the Visayas and above all on the large
Island of Mindanao.</p>

<p>The first earthquake of which the chronicles contain a mention is that
of 1599. There is no reasonable doubt that during the twenty-eight
years which had then elapsed since the founding of Manila by Legaspi,
several strong and possibly even destructive earthquakes occurred in
this part of Luzon Island, but, as the author of the "Verdadera
relaci&oacute;n de la grande destrucci&oacute;n * * * del a&ntilde;o 1645" tells us, "when
first founded, Manila consisted of wooden houses roofed with a certain
kind of palm leaves, the same which the natives use in their
buildings." Hence the damage done by these earthquakes must have been
insignificant. Much more terrible were the losses caused by
conflagrations which within a few years twice wiped out the entire
city.</p>

<p>The first Bishop of Manila, Domingo de Salazar, seeing the city
exposed to such general destructions by fire like the one of February
14, 1583, gave the first impulse to the construction of stone
buildings and worked indefatigably in this direction. In person he
explored the surroundings of Manila in quest of stone quarries and by
the middle of the year 1591 he had nearly finished his palace and the
cathedral, when financial difficulties caused a temporary suspension
of the work. At the same time a great number of public and private
buildings were under construction. The enthusiasm for structures of
stone or brick with tile roofs did not diminish during the next fifty
years. The chroniclers tell us that "the Spaniards began to build
their houses of stone and tiles without the so necessary precautions
against earthquakes. * * * Beautiful structures and dwelling houses
were reared, so high and spacious that they resembled palaces;
magnificent churches with lofty and graceful towers, within the walls
of Manila as well as outside of them: all of which made the city very
beautiful and gay and contributed equally to health and pleasure." The
disaster of 1645, commonly called the earthquake of St. Andrew, as it
occurred on the feast of this apostle, November 30, razed nearly every
one of these buildings to the ground, and since then the style and
appearance of buildings has changed greatly throughout the
Archipelago, with a correspondingly great saving of lives in the
subsequent earthquakes.</p>

<p>Masonry arches were henceforth banished from the churches; the heavy
walls of the latter were further strengthened by massive buttresses;
and the towers were given truly enormous substructures. But even with
these precautions there is at present hardly one out of the hundreds
of churches built during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
which did not some time or other require important repairs of its
masonry work or even partial reconstruction owing to earthquake
damages. The only structure of this class which thus far has withstood
all convulsions, is the church of St. Agustin, Manila. Nevertheless,
as we have stated before, the chroniclers hardly mention all this
destruction, except in a very general and cursory manner. I do not
hesitate to say: they were accustomed to see similar havoc created
nearly every year in one part of the Archipelago or the other by some
severe typhoon, accompanied by far greater loss of lives and property,
and consequently much more felt by the people than the destruction of
a church, <i>convento</i>, municipal building ("tribunal"), one or two
bridges, or other masonry structure.</p>

<p>In the present catalogue our aim has been to present all that is known
of the various violent and destructive earthquakes on record. The
first column of each page contains the ordinal number of the
disturbance for purposes of reference. In the second, the date is
given as accurately as it could be ascertained, Roman numerals being
used to designate the months. Unfortunately, of some earthquakes only
the year is known; of others, the year and month. Of one (No. 32) the
approximate hour has been recorded, but not the day of the month;
while of another (No. 38) the hour has been preserved for posterity,
but whether the phenomenon occurred during February or March, the
records leave undecided. In the third column will be found, in the
first place, the intensity of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>disturbance, Roman numerals
representing the degrees of the scale of De Rossi-Forel (I-X); then
the region affected most, and finally the damages caused, if known,
and other information, if available.</p>

<p>In describing the epicentral regions, the present distribution of the
Archipelago into provinces has been used throughout the catalogue.
This division is shown on the first of the two maps of the Philippines
which accompany this catalogue (Plate I). As to the designation
"Benguet" occasionally occurring in the text where provinces are
enumerated, but not found on the map, we beg to offer the excuse that
the region thus named is exceedingly well known in the Philippines as
it contains Baguio, <i>the</i> health resort of the Islands. For the
readers outside of the Archipelago we remark that Benguet is at
present a subprovince of the Mountain Province, of which it forms the
southernmost part. The location of Baguio is shown on the map on Plate
II. A similar remark applies to Lepanto and Bontoc, likewise divisions
of the Mountain Province, whose capitals, Cervantes and Bontoc, are
indicated on the same map.</p>

<p>As we would hardly be justified in assuming that every reader is in
possession of a detailed map of the Philippines, and a knowledge of
the general distribution and the main directions of the principal
mountain systems of an earthquake country is important, we add a
second map on which these data are shown by means of dashes, together
with the most important seismic regions, and the positions of the
principal towns, bays, etc., mentioned in the text. (Plate II.)</p>

<p>Near the left margin of this second map will be found an index of the
seismic regions just mentioned, each of them being represented by its
ordinal number (large Roman figures). Near each of these ordinals is
placed the corresponding number of earthquakes since 1862 contained in
the catalogue (Arabic figures), which is followed, in brackets, by an
analysis of the said number, in which Roman figures designate the
degrees of the earthquake, scale of De Rossi-Forel, while small Arabic
figures, written like exponents, give the number of earthquakes of
each degree of intensity.</p>

<p>In drawing the map on Plate II it was not intended to represent the
epicentric area of every individual earthquake center (which would
have crowded the map beyond reasonable limits), but rather to show the
principal seismic regions. Hence most of these curves contain more
than one focus. The approximate position of each of the latter has,
however, been indicated by a star, while the figure placed close to
the star gives the number of earthquakes which proceeded from the said
center.</p>

<p>A word must be said in apology for the constant use in the following
list of the Spanish word "<i>convento</i>." This word which means
monastery, cloister, or convent, is universally used in the
Philippines to designate also the habitation of the clergy attached to
a parish church. Although these are, as a rule, spacious buildings and
were formerly inhabited well-nigh exclusively by friars, they can not
properly be called monasteries. Wherefore, in order to avoid lengthy
circumlocutions, the Spanish word "<i>convento</i>" has been retained.</p>

<p>The reader who is not familiar with this country may find it strange
that in reporting earthquake damages so much emphasis appears to be
laid on the harm done to churches and <i>conventos</i>. This is easily
explained by the fact that these buildings were often the only
structures within the meizoseismal area, and built nearly everywhere
in the most substantial manner.</p>

<p>In the present catalogue we have also included, by way of an appendix,
the earthquakes which are known to have occurred in the Marianas or
Ladrones group of islands. While their number is too small to warrant
separate publication, we believe that the data concerning them will be
welcome to the earthquake investigator.</p>

    and Ilocos Norte it left no stone upon the
    other. In the capital, where during the
    preceding fifty years a great number of
    stone buildings had been erected,
    magnificent churches, palaces, and public
    buildings, as well as private residences
    and villas, the destruction was frightful.
    Ten churches were wrecked entirely, to
    wit: the Royal Chapel, Cathedral, Santo
    Domingo, those of the Recollects and
    Franciscans, Santiago, San Antonio,
    Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Guia, and the parish
    churches of Binondo and San Miguel; only
    San Agustin and the Jesuit Church remained
    standing. Twelve monasteries, colleges,
    and hospitals were likewise converted into
    ruins. No better fared the palace of the
    Governor-General, the Real Audiencia and
    up to 150 of the finest residences which,
    as one author puts it, "in other cities
    would have been considerable palaces." The
    rest of the private houses were damaged
    to so great an extent that the majority
    had to be demolished. The number of
    persons killed exceeded 600 and the total
    of killed and injured is stated to have
    been 3,000.<br />

    &nbsp; &nbsp; Outside of Manila there was a general
    destruction of villas and other buildings
    which had been erected on both banks of
    the Pasig River. Throughout the
    neighboring provinces the masonry
    structures built by the missionaries
    suffered the same fate as those in Manila.
    From the farthest provinces in the north
    were reported great alterations of the
    surface with almost complete disappearance
    of some native villages, changes in the
    courses of rivers, subsidences of plains,
    eruptions of sand, etc. All the writers of
    the time qualify this disturbance as the
    most disastrous earthquake not only in
    Luzon, but likewise in Mindoro,
    Marinduque, and the other islands south of
    Luzon. On the other hand, the provinces of
    Camarines and Albay appear to have
    suffered little or nothing.</td>

    house articles on shelves of these walls

    women's hospital, built of local mortar,
    was so badly injured as to require tearing
    down; its tiled roof slid off to westward
    and the worst cracks were in the east
    wall. Many ceiling boards in different
    houses were shaken down. Several fissures
    opened in the ground, from one of which,
    near the river, came a large flow of
    water. The river bed sank in several
    places. The passing wave could be seen
    distinctly as it crossed the plaza, and
    the station ship in the harbor reported
    having felt the shock. No damage of
    importance was done in the other towns on
    the island. The buildings of the cable
    station at Sumay, constructed of
    reinforced concrete, were not injured, but
    a few objects were thrown down and the
    steel water towers could be seen swaying.
    No shocks were noticed before or after the
    earthquake, nor was anything extraordinary

    not felt at Yap, Western Carolines. No
    information from the other islands.</td>

Produced by Marilynda Fraser-Cunliffe, Jeannie Howse, David
Garcia and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at
http://www.pgdp.net (This file was made using scans of
public domain works from the University of Michigan Digital
Libraries)


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
